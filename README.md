TODO:

Trigger refresh from git via external api url




This External Module will be used to checkout the master branch of GIT redcap-dev and update the REDCap server in the Dev directory.
This module can be used during development to bring over new code or new changes.

To perform a GIT pull, go to the REDCap DEV Control Panel and select the External Module page 'Playbook to update REDCap dev'.

If the Refresh was successful, there will be no messages displayed.  If the Refresh was not successful,
a status page will be displayed to indicate the update was not successful.
