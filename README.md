# Puppet Playbook

This utility module helps us with server/database related functions for our new docker-based deployment.


### It allows you to trigger a 'git pull' from the parent VM to update the docker containers or source code

You can also access this 'git pull' functionality from an api-based external url - see the status page in the control center for more information.

### It allows you to update embedded reference urls to itself in the database which is useful after a database restore
